# stm32_playground

A set of small STM32 projects for testing basic embedded features.

## Projects

- **Toggle_light** – simple example that blinks an LED using a custom GPIO driver.
- **ManualGPIO_Toggle** – toggles an LED when a button is pressed using a
  lightweight driver implementation.

This repository is my sandbox for experimenting with peripherals such as ADC,
I2C and general GPIO control as I learn embedded programming.
