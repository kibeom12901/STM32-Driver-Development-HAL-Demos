# stm32_playground

A set of small STM32 projects for testing basic embedded features.

## Projects

- **Toggle_light** – simple example that blinks an LED using a custom GPIO driver.
- **ManualGPIO_Toggle** – toggles an LED when a button is pressed using a lightweight driver implementation.
- **ExternalButton_IT** – toggles PD12 through an interrupt triggered by the PA0 user button with a small debounce delay.

This repository is my sandbox for experimenting with peripherals such as ADC, I2C and general GPIO control as I learn embedded programming.
