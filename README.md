# stm32_playground

This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with STM32 microcontrollers.
It contains example projects, such as a simple GPIO toggle demo, that help you
practice low-level driver development. Feel free to modify or extend the code to
match your own interests while learning about embedded systems.
