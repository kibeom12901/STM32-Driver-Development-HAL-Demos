# ADC_WaterSensor

This project demonstrates how to interface a **water level sensor** with an **STM32F407** using the STM32 HAL library.  
The sensorâ€™s analog output is read through the **ADC**, displayed on a **16Ã—2 LCD**, and used to control the brightness of an **external LED** via **PWM**.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **ADC (PC3 / ADC1_IN13)** reads the analog signal from the water sensor.  
- **DMA** is used to continuously update ADC values in memory without CPU overhead.  
- **PWM (TIM5_CH4 on PA3)** drives an LED, with brightness proportional to the water sensor value.  
- **16Ã—2 LCD** displays both the raw ADC reading and the mapped duty cycle percentage.

## âš¡ Hardware Connections
- **Water Sensor**  
  - `+` â†’ 3.3V  
  - `-` â†’ GND  
  - `S` â†’ PC3 (ADC input)  

- **LED (with ~220 Î© resistor)**  
  - `PA3 (TIM5_CH4, PWM output)` â†’ Resistor â†’ LED â†’ GND  

- **LCD 16Ã—2 (HD44780)**  
  - Connected in 4-bit mode via custom `clcd.c` driver  

---

## ðŸ“Š Behavior
- As the water sensor gets **wetter**, its output voltage increases.  
- The ADC value rises (approx. **400 â†’ 2000** in testing).  
- The LED brightness increases with the ADC value.  
- The LCD shows:  
  - **Line 1**: ADC value  
  - **Line 2**: Duty cycle %
