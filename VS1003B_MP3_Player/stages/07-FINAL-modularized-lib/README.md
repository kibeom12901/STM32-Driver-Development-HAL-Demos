# Stage 07 â€” FINAL Modularized Library Integration

This stage demonstrates the final, modularized version of the VS1003B MP3 Player.
All reusable code is now moved into `/lib`, which contains:
- `vs1003.c/h` â€” VS1003 driver
- `playlist.c/h` â€” FATFS playlist handler
- `player.c/h` â€” Playback logic
- `volume.c/h` â€” ADC-based volume control
- `button.c/h` â€” Gesture input handler
- `util_uart.c/h` â€” UART debug logger

Main.c now only initializes peripherals and calls library APIs.
