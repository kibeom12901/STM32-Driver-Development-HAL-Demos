Before integrating analog volume control, the ADC input was validated using a potentiometer connected to **PA1 (ADC1_IN1)**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
| Component | Setting |
|------------|----------|
| **Pin** | PA1 (ADC1_IN1) |
| **Mode** | Analog mode (No pull-up/pull-down) |
| **ADC Mode** | Single conversion, software-triggered |
| **Sampling Time** | 144 cycles |
| **Polling Method** | HAL_ADC_Start / PollForConversion |
| **Output** | Live UART print (USART2 @ 115200 baud) |
